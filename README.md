# Food-Sales-App

In this project, I studied the event funnel for a food purchasing app. The users for the app included two control groups and a “B” group based on changes made to the app. I analyzed the results of the A/A/B test and was unable to confirm any statistically significant differences in conversion rates between the groups with the data that had been collected in the test.
